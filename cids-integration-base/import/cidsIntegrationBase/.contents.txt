This directory contains init-scripts, dumps and role definitions that are imported into the PostgreSQL data base upon
container creation (run) when the 'import' flag is set. (host-mounted volume)

The contents of this directory are overlaid by a host-mounted volume that contains 
the actual dump files. 

WARNING: Existing databases in pg_data (data volume) are deleted!
