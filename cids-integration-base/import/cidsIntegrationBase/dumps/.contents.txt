This directory contains the actual database dump files (supported formats: .gz, 
.sql and .backup) that are imported into PostgeSQL database when the 'import' flag 
is passed to the container_ctl.sh startup script. For each dump file, a database 
with the same name is created and optional init and post-init scripts are executed 
before and after the dump is imported.
