This is apache maven's localRepository (MAVEN_BIB_DIR or lib/m2) and is only used
in an AUTO-DISTRUBUTION.

The image contains some 'problematic' dependencies that cannot be retrieved from public maven repositories.

For AUTO-DISTRUBUTIONs, this directory can safely declared a DATA VOLUME, since if the container’s base image 
contains data at the specified mount point, that existing data is copied into the new 
volume upon volume initialization. (Note that this does not apply when mounting a host directory!)
For **LEGCY-DISTRUBUTIONs** this directory must not be declared as volume!
