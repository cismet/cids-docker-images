This is apache maven's localRepository (MAVEN_BIB_DIR or lib/m2) and is only used
in an AUTO-DISTRUBUTION.

The image contains some 'problematic' dependencies that cannot retrieved from public maven repositories.

This directory can safely declared a DATA VOLUME, since if the containerâ€™s base image 
contains data at the specified mount point, that existing data is copied into the new 
volume upon volume initialization. (Note that this does not apply when mounting a host directory!)
