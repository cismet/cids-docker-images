cids ABF Library Management Configuration Files (local on docker host)

The content of this folder is neither part of the custom cids-distribution IMAGE nor
mounted as VOLUME, thus it is not prenstent in the running custom cids-distribution CONTAINER.! 

It is required when manually updating (with cidsABF) the custom cids-distribution IMAGE (e.g. add new dependency) 
or when modifying the RUNTIME configuration (e.g. requild res.jar) of a custom cids-distribution CONTAINER.
