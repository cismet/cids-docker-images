This is the server configuration directory (host mounted volume) 
All contents in the image (including this file) will be overlaid by a HOST-MOUNTED DOCKER VOLUME!

Each subdirectory (###-service-name) represents a java service that is controlled by cids_ctl.sh. Each service directory has to contain at least the the service control script cs_ctl.sh, optional startup- and shutdown-hook scripts (shutdown_hook.sh and startup_hook.sh) and any configuration filkes required by the service (e.g. runtime.properties, log4j.properties, ...)
